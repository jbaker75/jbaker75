This is a plan of action for some coding challenges I would like to consider for the balance of the year.

Background: I really enjoy learning about audio programming. I have recently discovered Csound and like the platform.

Goal: Develop some basic front end editors and simple (IDE) for Csound in various platforms. Don't go crazt, just
      provide the ability to load, edit, save a csd file or Csound code, execute it, get output from Csound and
      display to the user. Also of course play the sounds from the CSound.


Technologies:
      - Matlab Interface
      - Python Interface (TKinter)
      - Java Interface
      - C/C++ Interface with simple UI
      - C/C++ JUCE Interface
      - Python Interface (Textualize)

Constraints:
      - must be multiplatform
      - use Csound 7.0 (if possible)
      - must have some graphical capabilities such as viewing waveforms
      - use AI as a tool when needed but learn the basics of each platform from APIs and documentation

Like to have:
      - external MIDI support (from a keyboard)

Inspiration:
      - Csound web ide (but would like to expand)
